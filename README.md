# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The project is a data analysis of school district using Pandas library in Python code. The data is obtained from separate CSV files, which are pulled and read into Pandas, in order to analyze it.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to provide an analysis to the PyCitySchools school district, by analizing the student testing data for all schools in the district. The school district wants to analyze the following KPI's for all the schools in the district:

- Average math score for each grade
- Average reading score for each grade
- Percentage of passing students that passed math for each grade
- Percentage of passing students that passed rading for each grade
- Performance of each school by size
- School performance based on the budget (Correlation between budget and passing students)
- School performance based on the type

In addition, The School board suspects that math and reading grades for students in 9th grade at Thomas High School have been altered. They would like to know how the altered grades affect the overall school district analysis.

## Deliverable 1 

For this part of the project, the analysis was done by using the loc method, to execute logical arguments, compare, filter, and replace the math and reading scores for the 9th grades students at Thomas High School to NaNs.

## Deliverable 2

### The district summary

Results including the 9th grade scores

Results not including the 9th grade scores

As is shown from the table, the data from The Thomas High School 9th grade scores for reading and math have a small to none impact on the school district analysis. Meaning that the school district overall analysis is not affected.

Variances:

- Average Math score (**-0.1**) After adjusting
- Average Reading score same as before
- Percentage Passing Math (**-0.02%**) After adjusting
- Percentage Passing reading (**-0.03%**) After adjusting
- Overall Percentage (**-0.01%**) After adjusting

### The school summary

#### Original Analysis

#### Adjusted Analysis

As is shown in the previous tables, the data has been impacted by removing the 9th grade test result to

- Average Math score dropped **0.06**
- Average Reading score increased **0.14**
- Percentage passing Math dropped **26.36%**
- Percentage passing Reading dropped **27.64%**
- Percentage overall passing dropped **25.87**

### Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance vs the other schools

As the table shows the Thomas High School has the lowest % Passing in Math, Reading and Overall in all schools in the district:

- Percentage Math passing **66.911315%
- Percentage Reading passing **69.663609%	
- Overall Percentage **65.076453%

### By Replacing the Grades

Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
