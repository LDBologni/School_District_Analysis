# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The project is a data analysis of school district using Pandas library in Python code. The data is obtained from separate CSV files, which are pulled and read into Pandas, in order to analyze it.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to provide an analysis to the PyCitySchools school district, by analizing the student testing data for all schools in the district. The school district wants to analyze the following KPI's for all the schools in the district:

- Average math score for each grade
- Average reading score for each grade
- Percentage of passing students that passed math for each grade
- Percentage of passing students that passed rading for each grade
- Performance of each school by size
- School performance based on the budget (Correlation between budget and passing students)
- School performance based on the type

In addition, The School board suspects that math and reading grades for students in 9th grade at Thomas High School have been altered. They would like to know how the altered grades affect the overall school district analysis.

## Deliverable 1 

For this part of the project, the analysis was done by using the loc method, to execute logical arguments, compare, filter, and replace the math and reading scores for the 9th grades students at Thomas High School to NaNs.
